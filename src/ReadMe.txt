Explanation of how to run our website - ~ Users Flow ~ First, we assume that the viewer is currently located at "index.php". Here, you can view many posts that have a "public" sharing level. In the end, the is a copyright mark with 2 links, which move to the
About Page
Privacy Page In the navigator, there is a logo of our website, a search bar to look up the posts you want, and some icons.
Home icon: Return you to the "index.php".
Log-in button: Redirect you to the Log-in Page.
Messenger icon: Unavailable at the moment.
Heart icon: Unavailable at the moment.
Second, we assume that you clicked the Log-in button and now you are in "login_page.php". If you do have the accounts, enter them in the box and click "Log in". Else, you can click the " Register here" to register a new account.

Third, we assume that you clicked the "Register here" button, you should type in all of the inputs here, and follow the restriction until the border turn green. After all, you can "clear" all the inputs to retype a new one, or "Register" to successfully added to our database and use that to log in.

Fourth, we assume that you are now logged in and located at "newsfeed.php". This page act quite similar to the "index.php" but it is more open. You can see "Internal" sharing-level posts here. Above the first post, there is an "Add Post" button for you to quickly upload a new post. Once clicked, the pop-up will appear, fill in all of the requirements then click "Upload" to upload your post to the server, and we will save your post to our database.

Fifth, now, the previous "Log-in Button" on the navigation bar has changed to your avatar. We assume that you have clicked on that, and redirected to "profile_page.php". On this page, you can see your avatar ( you can change it if you want, just simply click on your avatar.), your name, numbers of posts, followers, and your followings. Also, you can write a short description of yourself here.

Add Post button: act as the " Add Post " button in "newsfeed.php", use to upload your post.
Log out button: use to log out of your account, and return to the "index.php" Below that, there are posts that you have uploaded since you created your account.
That is the end of the ~ Users Flow ~

~ Admin Flow ~ TOP SECRET ~

The admin cannot be accessed in the normal way, you have to manually type in the path into the search bar. (example: http://localhost/instakilogram/FullStackWebApplication/php/login_admin_page.php ) to move to this page.

First, as we created a hard-code account for admin, we assume that you have successfully logged-in the "login_admin_page.php" with the account we provided below

From here, we follow the Full-stack Web Application -> Assessment Detail -> 5: Functional Requirements -> 5.6 User and Image Management.
